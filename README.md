# Astro Starter Kit: Spotify clone

## ðŸ‘€ Why did I make this?

Now that I want to introduce myself in the "allegedly" amazing world of Astro to crate static websites, I'm gonna start this journey keeping up one video from Midudev.

I'll be sharing my thoughts and learnings on the framework while keeping the tutorial, hope I get the love for Astro as much as other people do.


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
